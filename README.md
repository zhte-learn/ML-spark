ML, bagging, cross-validation with Spark

This project was undertaken as part of the "Big Data Mining Techniques and Implementation" course at the University of Wollongong in Dubai.

Goal: predict the actual worth of real estate transactions using various regression models.

Dataset: sourced from the Dubai Land Department;

Multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regression, were employed to predict the actual worth of each transaction based on relevant features. 
Bagging with Gradient Boosting and Cross-validation to further enhance model performance was implemented without relying on any external libraries.
